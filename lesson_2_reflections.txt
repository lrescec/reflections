What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-It creates a .git file and makes that repository and files in it available for tracking history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

-staging area is a place in between those two, you put in it everything that's ready for commit and makes a logical unit. You can add files from one unit when you are done working on it and go on working on other files related to it and then when you're done with all of them, make a commit.
