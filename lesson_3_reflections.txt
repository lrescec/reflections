When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-When I'm not the only one working on a project, so I'll want to share what we've done easily with each other.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-If I have something on my local repository that isn't finished yet, I might not want to make it public.
